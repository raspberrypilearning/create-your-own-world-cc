Click and drag with the mouse to draw a line with the pencil. Your goal is to stop the cats from falling into holes by creating a safe path to the exit.

If you want to make a game using Python instead of Scratch, try out the [RPG](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpg?utm_source=pathway&utm_medium=whatnext&utm_campaign=projects) project.
